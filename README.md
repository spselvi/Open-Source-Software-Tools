CRN’s list of the coolest open-source software in 2021 includes tools for developing next-generation applications, 
It can be adapting applications to a SaaS model, sharing and analyzing data, managing Kubernetes systems and costs, and building and deploying machine learning models.
10 Types :
   1.open for business:
      Open-source software tools are increasing in popularity because of the multiple advantages they provide including lower software and hardware costs, lack of vendor lock-in, simpler license management . A recent report from MarketsandMarkets cited ongoing migration to cloud systems and digital transformation.Open-source software is also critical for solution and strategic service providers.The MarketsandMarkets report concludes that the global market for professional and managed services around open-source software will grow at an 18.2 percent compound annual growth rate from $21.7 billion this year to $50.0 billion in 2026.The Linux operating system, MySQL database and Kubernetes container platform are among the most widely used open-source software
   2.Apache Kylin:
       Kylin was originally developed within eBay.Apache Kylin is a distributed OLAP (online analytical processing) analytics engine that provides a SQL interface and multidimensional analysis  for working with huge volumes of data.The Kylin community recently debuted Kylin 4 that offers improved query performance and is easier to deploy and scale in the cloud. It improving scalability by decoupling compute and storage functions. The new release also removes dependencies on the Hadoop platform.Earlier this year Kyligence debuted a cloud-native edition of its Kyligence Enterprise platform.
   3.AWS SaaS Boost
        AWS SaaS Boost is a tool used by ISVs to migrate their existing software to a Software-as-a-Service delivery model. SaaS including providing the foundational capabilities needed to provision IT infrastructure for tenants, on-board users, monitor consumption trends, configure tenant profiles, integrate applications.AWS previewed SaaS Boost at the re:Invent 2020 conference in December and began offering it in May of this year on the GitHub open-source code repository service under the Apache 2.0 license.
    4.Crystal:
        Crystal 1.0 was released in March after some 10 years of development by noted developers Ary Borenzweig, Brian J. Cardiff and Juan Wajnerman, along with several hundred other contributors .Crystal is a new general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that the technology’s creators describe as a language for humans and computers.
The compiled system programming language is said to provide the efficiency and performance of the C programming language with the ease of use and productivity of the Ruby programming language.The latest release of Crystal (1.2.2 out on Nov. 10, 2021) is available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license.
    5.Delta Sharing:
        Big data software developer Databricks is behind the Delta Sharing initiative, launched in May, to create an open-source data sharing protocol for securely sharing data across organizations in real time.Delta Sharing, included within the open-source Delta Lake 1.0 project, establishes a common standard for sharing all data types—structured and unstructured.It can be used in SQL, visual analytics tools, and programming languages such as Python and R. Large-scale datasets also can be shared in the Apache Parquet and Delta Lake formats in real time without copying.It  including Nasdaq, S&P and Factset, and leading IT vendors including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google Cloud, according to Databricks.
   6.Grafana:
      The Grafana software is developed by New York-based Grafana Labs, which also markets commercial enterprise and cloud service editions of the software along with Grafana-related services.Grafana is an open-source data observability platform for collecting and analyzing metric, log and trace data generated by IT infrastructure, networks, cybersecurity tools and other systems.It can be used to visualization, dashboarding and alerting capabilities are used by IT and AppDev managers to monitor IT system performance and track users and events.About 800,000 businesses and organizations already use Grafana, about 90 percent of them using the open-source version that’s available under the AGPLv3 open-source license.In November Grafana Labs struck a strategic partnership with Microsoft to develop a Grafana managed service that runs on the Azure cloud platform.
it is similar to a partnership the startup has with Amazon Web Services..
   7.Kubecost:
       Kubecost, developed by San Francisco-based Stackwatch, is an open-source tool for monitoring and reducing Kubernetes spending.The proliferation of Kubernetes across cloud systems is making it difficult for IT managers to track and control cloud computing costs.Managers can view costs across clusters in a single view or via a single API endpoint, according to the kubecost.com website, and the tool alerts users to cost overruns and infrastructure outage risks.Kubecost runs on AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform and other Kubernetes environments, including on-premises.Kubecost is offered on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license while Stackwatch provides a commercial edition of the software.
    8.Minikube:
        Minikube is an open-source utility that makes it possible to run Kubernetes on a Windows, Mac or Linux laptop or desktop PC.The lightweight implementation of Kubernetes creates a single node cluster contained in a virtual machine, making it easier to perform Kubernetes development tasks.Kubernetes deployments without having to install the entire Kubernetes system, according to the Sensu by Sumo Logic website.The current release of Minikube, v1.24.0, is available on GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license.
    9.Nrwl Nx:
        Nrwl Nx is developed by Narwhal Technologies and offered under the open-source MIT License.It is a toolkit and framework for building, testing and scaling enterprise-grade Angular applications.is a toolkit and framework for building, testing and scaling enterprise-grade Angular applications.The Nrwl Nx user ecosystem includes Accenture, American Airlines, Cisco Systems, Federal Express, Microsoft and Red Hat.such as cache restoration and project graph construction, consolidated workspace and project configuration, project-specific configuration files, target dependencies.It support for TypeScript compiler plugins with NestJS, and a new NxDocs website. Nx 13.3 is the current release.
    10.Red Hat OKD:
        OpenShift, Red Hat’s Kubernetes container software and tools, is a key element of the company’s multi-cloud/hybrid-cloud strategy.It a community distribution of Kubernetes that is optimized for continuous application development and multi-tenant deployment.OKD is built around a core of OCI (Open Container Initiative) container packaging and Kubernetes container cluster management technologies.That provides a complete open-source container application platform, according to the okd.io website.All OKD project source code is available under the Apache License on GitHub. OKD 4.9.0 is the current stable release of the software.
   11.TensorFlow:
        TensorFlow was originally developed within Google for internal use and then released in 2015 under the Apache 2.0 License.While TensorFlow competes with other open-source ML frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow’s use has quickly grown since Google released TensorFlow 2.0 in September 2019.With the growing use of machine learning there has been an explosion of commercial software products for building and deploying machine learning models and managing the data used to train and run them.  TensorFlow, an open-source platform for developing and training machine learning models.TensorFlow has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community sources that help researchers “push the state-of-the art” iToday a broad range of businesses are using TensorFlow including Airbnb, Coca-Cola, GE Healthcare, Google, Intel and Twitter.
